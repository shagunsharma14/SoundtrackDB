xml
Copy code
<music>

        <name>Artist Name</name>
        <albums>
            <album>
                <title>Album Title</title>
                <tracks>
                    <track>
                        <title>Track Title</title>
                        <genre>Genre Name</genre>
                        <length>Track Length (in seconds)</length>
                        <rating>Track Rating (out of 100)</rating>
                        <play_count>Track Play Count</play_count>
                    </track>
                    <!-- more track elements -->
                </tracks>

            <!-- more album elements -->
        </albums>
    </artist>
    <!-- more artist elements -->
</music>
Running the program
To extract data from the input XML file and store it in the itune_tracks_db_sqllite SQLite database, run the extract_music_data.py script with the following command:

Copy code
python extract_music_data.py input_file.xml output_file.db
where input_file.xml is the name of the input XML file and output_file.db is the name of the output SQLite database file.

Accessing the Database
To access the itune_tracks_db_sqllite database, use any SQLite client or library. The database file is a standalone file that can be moved, copied, or shared as needed.
